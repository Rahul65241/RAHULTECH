          It might have happened so many times that you or someone yours need doctor’s help immediately,
           but they are not available due to some reasons.The Disease Prediction system is an end user
            support and online consultation project. Here, we propose a web application that allow users 
            to get instant guidance on their disease through an intelligent system. The application is 
            fed with various details and the disease associated with those details.The application allows
             user to share their disease related issues.It then processes user specific details to check 
             for various illness that could be associated with it.Here we use some intelligent data mining
              techniques to guess the most accurate illness that could be associated with patient’s details.
              Based on result, patient can contact doctor accordingly for further treatment.
